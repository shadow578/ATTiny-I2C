# ATTiny I2C
This is what is left of an attempt to use i2c on an attiny13. 
I don't really know the issues i encountered with this solution, but I vaguely remember it working with a 16x2 display at some point.
However, as the attiny13's memory was too limited, i scrapped the project halfway through.


TinySoftWire.h (and .c) _should_ countain the latest codebase, but again i'm not really sure.

## Disclaimer
Feel free to use this lib (and refine it ;)). However, I do not gurantee this to work in __any__ way. 
So use at your own risk.

Additionally, this implementation _somewhat_ stretches the i2c specification, so it may not be compatible with all devices.
